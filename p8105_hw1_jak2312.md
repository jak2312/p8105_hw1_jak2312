## Problem 1

  - Create a data frame comprised of:
      - a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
      - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
        greater than 0
      - a character vector of length 10
      - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
  - Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe

<!-- end list -->

``` r
prob1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_pos = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h","i","j"),
    fact_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mid", "mid", "mid", "mid", "high", "high", "high"))
  )
```
