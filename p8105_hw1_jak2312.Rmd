## Problem 1
* Create a data frame comprised of:
  + a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  + a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  + a character vector of length 10
  + a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
  
```{r create_df}
prob1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_pos = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h","i","j"),
    fact_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mid", "mid", "mid", "mid", "high", "high", "high"))
  )
```

Mean of each variable in prob1_df:

```{r}

```
